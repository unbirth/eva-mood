# Eva's Current Mood
This is my recent project. I'll try to complete it in one evening. Perfectly it should let you login on VK.com or choose any user on VK and see how many pictures did he save recently. Then it should build a graph. OR. Just set the maximal amount of pictures and count the today's amount, then show mood icon like in the Sims.
